## 📖 About

Everyone has wondered what lies beneath the [waves](https://modrinth.com/mod/tidal-waves); at the bottom of the ocean, beyond our grasp in that seemingly *infinite* abyss. Abysm is a mod about that curiosity. Breathing new life into the oceans of Minecraft, one biome at a time.

Originally created with lots of love for Mod Garden: Nature by Spirit Studios & friends. <3

This is our biggest project ever, we hope you enjoy it!
